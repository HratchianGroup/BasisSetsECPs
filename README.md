# Basis Sets and ECPs

This directory includes text files (*.gbs and *.ecp) defining basis sets and effective core potentials used by the Hratchian Group (at the University of California, Merced) that are not standard in the Gaussian suite of electronic structure programs. As such, the files provide basis sets and ECPs in the format expected by Gaussian from an input file using the `Gen`, `GenECP`, `ExtraBasis`, and `Pseudo=Read` keywords/options.

In all cases, the basis set and ECP files include appropriate references that should be cited in subsequent publications.
